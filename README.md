# Unity Code Snippets for Visual Studio

This repository includes more than 25 Visual Studio code snippets for Unity specific methods, statements, etc.

Visual Studio has its own built-in code snippets for commonly used C# features, however developers such as me need Unity specific code snippets for faster coding. So, I have created a couple of snippets for Unity, I hope you guys like them!

**[You can find a guide which demonstrates how to import code snippets to Visual Studio in here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-creating-a-code-snippet?view=vs-2022#import-a-code-snippet)**
 
Each snippet has its own shortcut which starts with "u". Additionally, you can change shortcuts by editing the line ```<Shortcut>uTheShortcut</Shortcut>``` in the .xml (.snippet) files.
